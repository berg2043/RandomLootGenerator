# RandomLootGenerator v1.01
Dungeons and Dragons Random Loot generator 

This project will eventually have a random loot generator that has a fully fleshed out GUI.  Currently, this is my work on said project. 

Much of the reference files will not be uploaded as they are not my property.

11/26/18 Created proof of concept that rolled on an item table from an xlsx file  
11/27/18 Added CR and type indentifiers  
01/21/19 Added a rudimentary GUI that works with CR 1-4  
01/25/19 Updated to accommodate all challenge ratings and added a section for gems and art that will be expanded upon in a future update  
04/08/19 Updated to roll each magic item and art/gem object. This is the first fully functional version  
04/09/19 Created a JSON based loot generator that is much faster than the excel based version.  An excel file and accompanying converter are included to make changing the tables easier.
